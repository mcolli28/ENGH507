    <h3>Personal Biography</h3>
<section><p> On this page, I'd like to share some of my experiences with you. To do so, I have orgnaized my page into three sections, seen below.</p></section>

<h4 class=h4 id=foods> Favorite Foods</h4>        
<section><p>Food plays a very important role in my life. Not only does it keep me alive, but I typically enjoy eating it. Some of my favorite foods include:</p>
        <ul class=list> 
            <li> Pizza</li>
            <li> Burgers</li>
            <li>Chipotle, which is not a food type, but is a chain so important to me it supersedes the product it offers</li>
    </ul></section>
        <figure> <img src="Photos/pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza">  </figure> <figcaption>Pizza is a foreign food from Italy. Because many Americans may be unfamiliar with international cuisine, I have included a photo of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza" target="_blank"> pizza</a> here. If you would like to download this photo of pizza for safekeeping, please <a href="Photos/pizza.jpg" download>click here. </a> </figcaption>

<h4 class=h4 id=places> Places I have lived</h4> 
        <section><p>I was born in <i>Arkansas</i>, but moved to <i>Virginia</i> just before starting kindergarten. To this day I am still the only person I have met from <i>Arkansas</i>.</p>
        <p>I grew up in southwest <i>Virginia</i>. I know the cities and towns of this part of <i>Virginia</i> well; however, when I tell people from northen <i>Virginia</i> this is where I grew up, I generally just tell them I grew up near <strong>Virginia Tech</strong> &#40;which was about  a 30-minute drive south from where i lved.&#41;</p>
        <p>For college, I moved to <i>Newport News, VA</i> &#40;for more information on this time in my life, check out the <a href="EducationHistory.html#undergrad">education History</a> page&#41;</p>
        <p> I moved to northern <i>Virginia</i> after college to begin work. Although I got my first job directly out of college working for a local newspaper, I quickly joined many of my peers and friends who either moved to northern <i>Virginia</i> after college or were originally from here and moved back.</p>
        <p> After spending a few years in northern <i>Virginia</i>, I wanted a change of pace, so I moved to San Diego without much of a plan. I lived by the beach there from early 2017 to mid 2018, a total of 18 months. I had a great time there and miss the beach every day.</p>

<aside>    <p>While in San Diego, I took up surfing. It was a really fun activity, but just as i was getting the hangof it I was stung by a stingray and became paranoid about walking on the ocean floor. Ironically, if I had been stricter about my surfing, I would have paddled out instead of walking out, avoiding the injury.</p></aside>

<h4 class=h4 id=interests> My Interests</h4> 
        <section><p>I'm interested in many things, but given the current state of the world, I've become increasingly interested in activites that can be done in isolation and how I can avoid public transportation. One of my more recent hobbies has been cycling. I've had a bicycle for a few years that has been gathering dust, but it has seen more use recently than ever before. The trails around the national capital region are quite impressive and you really have quite a bit of access to many places.</p></section>
