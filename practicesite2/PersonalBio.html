    <h3>Personal Biography</h3>
<section><p> On this page, I'd like to share some of my experiences with you. To do so, I have orgnaized my page into three sections, seen below.</p></section>

<h4 class=h4 id=foods> Favorite Foods</h4>        
<section><p>Food plays a very important role in my life. Not only does it keep me alive, but I typically enjoy eating it. Some of my favorite foods include:</p>
        <ul class=list> 
            <li> Pizza</li>
            <li> Burgers</li>
            <li>Chipotle, which is not a food type, but is a chain so important to me it supersedes the product it offers</li>
    </ul></section>
        <figure> <img src="Photos/pizza.jpg" alt="Matt on a hike">  </figure> <figcaption>Pizza is a foreign food from Italy. Because many Americans may be unfamiliar with international cuisine, I have included a photo of pizza here. </figcaption>

<h4 class=h4 id=places> Places I have lived</h4> 
        <section><p>I was born in Arkansas, but moved to Virginia just before starting kindergarten. To this day I am still the only person I have met from Arkansas.</p>
        <p>I grew up in southwest Virginia. I know the cities and towns of this part of Virginina well; however, when I tell people from northen Virginia this is where I grew up, I generally just tell them I grew up near Virginia Tech &#40;which was about  a 30-minute rive south from where i lved.&#41;</p>
        <p>For college, I moved to Newport News, VA &#40;<a href="EducationHistory.html#undergrad">  for more information on this time in my life, check out the education History page&#41;</a></p>
        <p> I moved to northern Virginia after college to begin work. Although I got my first job directly out of college working for a local newspaper, I quickly joined many of my peers and friends who either moved to northern Virginina after college or were originally from here and moved back.</p>
        <p> After spenmding a few years in northern Virginia, I wanted a change of pace, so I moved to San Diego without much of a plan. I lived by the beach tehre from early 2017 to mid 2018, a total of 18 months. I had a great time there and miss the beach every day.</p>
        </section>

<h4 class=h4 id=interests> My Interests</h4> 
        <section><p>I'm interested in many things, but given the current state of the world, I've become increasingly interested in activites that can be done in isolation and how I can avoid public transportation. One of my more recent hobbies has been cycling. I've had a bicycle for a few years that has been gathering dust, but it has seen more use recently than ever before. The trails around the national capital region are quite impressive and you really have quite a bit of access to many places.</p></section>
