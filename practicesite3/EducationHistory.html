								<h4>K&ndash;12</h4>
								<p>I underwent a traditional schooling experience in my hometown of <i>Salem, VA</i>, where I began kindergarten and graduated high school in the same public school system. At <strong><a href="http://shs.salem.k12.va.us" target="_blank"> Salem High School</a> </strong> I took a mix of standard and advanced classes, called International Baccalaureate, or IB classes. many of the IB classes were dual enrolled with the local community college. Because of this, I transferred many credits to my <strong><a href="http://cnu.edu" target="_blank"> Christopher Newport University</a> </strong>, where I had decided to go to undergrad.</p>

								 <h4>Undergrad</h4>
        <section><p>Since I started college with so many credits, I was able to skip many of my general education requirements and begin working on my degrees early. Thanks to my academic advisor, I realized I could easily pursue two degrees within four years. I decided to pursue both history and communication degrees. <strong><a href="http://cnu.edu" target="_blank"> CNU</a> </strong> is a public University located in <i>Newport News, VA</i> and is known for the following attributes:</p></section>
     <section><ul> 
    <li> The Great Lawn - A large patch of grass that functions as the center of the campus. Rumored to have spray-painted grass to make it appear greener. </li>
         <li> The Commons - A dining hall known for fast-food style meals like burgers and fries</li>
         <li>Columns - The neo-classical architecture used at <strong><a href="http://cnu.edu" target="_blank">CNU</a> </strong> means you'll always have a column in your line of site. </li>
         
        </ul></section>

<aside>     <p>My final semester at <strong>CNU</strong> was also my most eventful one. During this semester, I completed my communication thesis, was selected to present my thesis at my school's academic conference, made Dean's list, and graduated! </p></aside>

								<h4>The Road to Graduate School</h4>
    <section><p>In 2014, I graduated with both degrees and joined the work force. I had always planned on attending graduate school, but I was eager to use my skills in a professional setting and wanted to wait for better timing to join a program. </p>
            <p>Eventually, I was able to apply to <strong><a href="https://www2.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">George Mason University's</a> </strong> English program, which aligns with my professional life, and will teach me many skills to be a better worker. </p></section>
