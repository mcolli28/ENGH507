        <h2 id=Experience> Professional Experience</h2>
      <section> 
            <p> I bring a wealth of writing and editing experience from a wide array of professional environments, including scientific research, research and development, Information Technology (IT), and physical security. My work has exposed me to multiple federal agencies, where I have worked directly with federal government employees. My duties have ranged from collecting and disseminating meeting notes and records management of weekly/monthly reports to drafting, editing, and finalizing a variety of technical documents, technical reports, technical manuals and technical notes both as the author of the documents and an editor of othersâ€™ documents. I have experience writing standard operating procedures, user guides, governance documentation, requirements documentation, system documents, and technical proposals. I have years of experience in gathering complex and precise technical data translating it into easy-to-read and understand documentation. I also have great communication skills by being able to effectively interview and gather precise information from subjects outside his field of expertise, while being able to document it thoroughly and effectively.</section>
