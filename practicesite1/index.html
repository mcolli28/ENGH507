<h2 id="Student"> Student Experience </h2>
    <Section> 
    <p>  I underwent a traditional schooling experience in my hometown of Salem, VA, where I began kindergarten and graduated high school in the same public school system. At Salem High School I took a mix of standard and advanced classes, called international Baccalaureate, or IB classes. many of the IB classes were dual enrolled with the local community college. Because of this, I transferred many credits to my Chsitrtohper Newport University, where I had decided to go to undergrad. Since I started college with so many credits, I was able to skip many of my general education requirements and begin working on my degrees early. Thanks to my academic advistor, I realized I could easily pursue two degrees within  four years. I decided to pursue both History and Communication degrees. In 2014, I graduated with both degrees and joined the work force. I had always planned on attending  graduate school, but i was eager to use my skills in a professional setting and wanted to wait for better timing to join a program. Eventually, I was able to apply to George Mason's English program, which aligns with my professional life, and will teach me many skills to be a better worker. </p>
